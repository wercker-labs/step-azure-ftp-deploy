# azure-ftp-deploy

Deploy your code to Windows Azure using FTP.
Used in wercker-labs/windows, the experimental wercker windows box

To use:
* Go to Windows Azure https://manage.windowsazure.com.
* Create a new web site.
* On the dashboard, download the publish profile.
* Get the `publishProfile` element with `publishMethod="FTP"`.
* Get `publishUrl`, `userName` and `userPWD`.

# Options

* `files` The files to test, use space as seperator. When left empty, all dll's with "test" in their name will be tested.

* `publish-url` (required) Full FTP path to upload to. Should start with ftp:// and end with wwwroot.
* `username` (required) Username to connect to FTP server. _You must escape `\` and `$`, see example. If you have issues, Azure may allow just the part following `\$`. In the example below, this would be `test`
* `password` (required) Password to connect to FTP server

# Example

Add AZURE_PASSWORD as deploy target or application environment variable.

```yaml
build:
  steps:
    - wercker-labs/azure-ftp-deploy:
        publish-url: ftp://waws-prod-blu-003.ftp.azurewebsites.windows.net/site/wwwroot
        username: test\\\$test
        password: $AZURE_PASSWORD
```
